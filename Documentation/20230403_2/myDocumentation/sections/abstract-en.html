<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
This ontology serves as the basis to represent technical standards in a machine readable way. It provides elements to define publications, their provisions, their dependencies and possible constraints, among other constructs.

This ontology is based on three technical standars, namely the IEC 62443 4-2, ETSI 303645 and the more general NIST Framework  for Improving
Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity.

Therefore, besides providing the schematic elements,  it also considers system related concepts to describe system solutions, their components, etc.

Making it possible to define not only project or system specific information but also project independent information. This makes it more robust for engineering design tasks.</span>
